# REVIEW

* MVC + RAILS

* Rails: framework which is easy to use, spins up applications quickly, based on Ruby

* Model - talks to the database & represents the data
* View - renders HTML to client & displays data to users
* Controller - calls actions that communicate with model & view

* Router - information from client to controller

* Rails Routes: `verb "prefix", to: "controller#action"`
* Root route: `root to: "controller#action"`


* Generate new controller: `rails g controller controller_name_plural`
